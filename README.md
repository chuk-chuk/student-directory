# Student-Directory #

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at **Villians Academy**.

The script will be invoked from _the command-line_ and it will only use _vanilla Ruby_, that is, there will be no external libraries to use. It will have text-based interface that will not look particularly exciting.

## How to use ##
```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
